            <h2>JAMIE FLOYD: UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h2>
            <br>
            <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I
                do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano
                and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p>
                <br>
            <h2>DONNA AND SCOTT: RESCUED RENOVATION</h2>
            <br>
            <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We
                recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond,"
                but on HGTV or TLC!"</p>
                <br>
            <h2>DAVID SIEGEL: DOUBLED THE VALUE</h2>
            <br>
            <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the
                value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make
                home improvements."</p>
